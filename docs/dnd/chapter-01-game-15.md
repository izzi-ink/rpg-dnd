# Chapter 1: Game 15

## 2 December 2023

### The Orc Caves and the Approach

The characters plunder the caves where the orcs made their residence and dispatched of a few orcs while stealthily (and by manipulation) making their way in and out of the caves without too much incident.

The party has finally reached the valley where the Temple is as the aarakocra are good to their word and drop the party off there.

From there, the party camps for the evening.
