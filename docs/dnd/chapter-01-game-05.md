# Chapter 1: Game 5

## 1 April 2023

Mostly a travelling montage.

We departed Jax's Castle and travelled southest and around the edge of the mountain range. During our 
travelling we encountered a pair of boars, that we thoroughly electrified.

We continued south through Perrenland, and eventually arrived at the Stumbling Stirge tavern in Clatsberg
of the Canton of Clatspurgen. There we met the two owners: A changeling and a Human. Generally the clientelle of the
establishment is a gregarious sort.

Molly intends to perform the next day.
