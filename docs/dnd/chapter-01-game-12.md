# Chapter 1: Game 12

## 28 October 2023

### Come Fly with Me

The aarakocra leads us on and asks if he can give us a side quest to take care of a few humanoids.

We and 5 aarakocra go up against 4 Leucrotta and 1 Lamia.

A female with a beautiful humanoid upper body that merges into a powerful four-legged leonine form lies here. Its vicious black claws speak to its predatory nature, as does its hunger for torture and humanoid flesh. This female figure is guarded by four creatures that look as if you took the head of a giant badger, the legs of a deer, and the body of a large hyena, then put them together and reanimated them with demon ichor without bothering to cover up the stink of death.

We eventually slay them all, after the lamia attempts to impersonate Finn and trick Molly, and slaying the last Leucrotta in a cave, where we see a shiny object inside, and hear the distant sounds of drums.

In the cave, that sparkling you see is a suit of Elven chainmail. Something an elf would benefit from wearing. a red gem sits next to the chainmail, and a pouch as well.

A jeweled bracelet is near the corner of the opening of the cave which looks like it was the home of the lamia.

Lokur and Molly notice something that startles them. A pipe and the pipe looks oddly familiar. Next to the pipe lies a hagstone necklace. Again, very familiar looking.

Off in the farthest corner of this bower is a robe that is in complete tatters, stained with blood and looks as if once it was a magnificent robe. The robe looks oddly familiar as well. And then it hits Lokur and Molly...

When we begin next week, you'll all be in the cave, everyone fully rested and healed, all spells memorized, and you see some coins leading out the cave by the wall. As if they were carried out by someone or something...
