# Chapter 1: Game 9

## 2 September 2023

**It's A Small World**

As we search the room, we notice that there are some bodies (including Lux and Finn) that have mysteriously gone missing when we turn back towards them.

We retreat back to the inn, and split the loot then take a long rest.

The next morning, Eritrea is handed a note by an odd goblin saying that our friends bodies were likely taken to the Temple of Tharizdun, and that the goblin Barzad can take us to the Kershane Monastry where we can then go to stop what ever nefarious deed is happening.

We take a boat ride with Captain Jamaal (a goblin) and Barzad, down the Kershane Pass and arrive at the Kershane Monastry to 4 monks that are totally our friends now. They lead us up to the Monastry.

We meet a creepy guy who won't look at us and says he's been expecting us. Clearly knows Jax, and he asks us to sit so we can chit chat. his name is Thallen.

We will have to visit Gnomevale on the way to the temple of Tharizdun. He was a big bad, got banished, been trying to get back. his followers are trying to get him back. AHHH IT IS THE SAME THING WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR. The black Cyst?

Molly writes a song for Gnomevale:
It's a world of laughter
A world of tears
It's a world of hopes
And a world of fears
There's so much that we share
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all

It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world

There is just one moon
And one golden sun
And a smile means
Friendship to ev'ryone
Though the mountains divide
And the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all

It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world

We eventually get to gnome vale, meet the gnomes and they have a giant norker problem. and a giant giant problem.

Groorg has taken up residence in the temple, and Gwaylar (leader of the gnomes) wants us to deal with him.
