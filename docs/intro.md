# The Campaign Setting

Located north of the Burneal Forest, the Thunder Cult, an ancient cult of people that worshipped the god (lesser) of Sky and Weather, [Velnius](https://greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/index.php?title=Velnius), built a keep in the frozen north off the coast of the Dramidj Ocean known as Thunderclap Keep. Rumors and tales have swirled around for many centuries that a weapon of great power is held up in the icy crypt. A weapon so powerful, it is rumored that the Undying King, Vecna once held this weapon in hand but was defeated by a group of adventurers who ascended to divinity. No one knows what the weapon is, but all sorts of weapons have been thrown in the myths and rumors over the millennia.

Many different stories have circulated about who the adventurers were and what is in the keep these days but no one knows for sure because of a cataclysmic event that occurred that buried the keep under several feet of ice and snow. Not including the harsh, cold climate of the land, no one has set foot (that is known) anywhere near the area where the keep was last known.

Within the last three hundred years, many have tried to follow up on the stories and the legends and myths that swirl around in taverns and inns, no one that has left has come back alive or never been seen again. Thousands have died and bodies have been found and the names of those that have made the search for the keep have died trying to find the keep, known only as Thunderclap Keep.
