## Backstory

In the cold and unforgiving land of Damara, where shadows cast long and the nights are deep and mysterious, Mara Kulenov was born into a humble family. From a young age, she displayed an unusual fascination with the night and darkness. While other children feared the shadows, she found comfort in their embrace, feeling a connection to something greater lurking within.

As Mara grew older, her affinity for darkness only deepened, leading her to seek answers and guidance from the local clergy. She found solace and wisdom within the temple of Shar, the enigmatic goddess of loss, darkness, and night. The teachings of the clergy spoke to her soul, revealing that darkness was not merely an absence of light but a source of power, secrets, and hidden knowledge.

Under the guidance of the priests of Shar, Mara honed her spiritual abilities and delved into the mysteries of the night. She studied the ancient texts, learned sacred rituals, and embraced the dark magic that her goddess bestowed upon her followers. Her unwavering devotion to Shar earned her the recognition of the temple, and she was initiated as a cleric of the Goddess of Loss.

Over the years, Mara became known for her quiet strength, empathy, and her ability to comfort those who had experienced loss. She saw the balance in life and death, understanding that darkness was an essential aspect of existence, and not something to be feared. Her serene presence and profound understanding drew people to her, both as confidants seeking solace and as disciples eager to learn from her teachings.

However, darkness also brought its own challenges. There were those who saw Shar's worshippers as agents of malevolence and chaos, and they viewed Mara and her fellow clerics with suspicion and fear. Despite the prejudices and misconceptions, Mara remained steadfast, striving to showcase the true essence of her goddess's teachings - that darkness was a natural part of the world and could bring balance, rather than destruction.

As the years passed, Mara's devotion to Shar and her mission to dispel fear and misunderstanding bore fruit. The temple's influence in Damara grew, and more people began to understand the beauty and complexity of the night. She helped countless individuals come to terms with loss, guiding them through their darkest hours, and embracing the shadows with newfound courage.

In time, word of Mara's wisdom and compassion spread beyond Damara's borders, reaching other lands within the Forgotten Realms. People from various walks of life sought her counsel, making pilgrimages to the temple of Shar in search of answers and enlightenment.

Yet, as her influence grew, so did the responsibilities and challenges that came with it. Mara knew that there were darker forces at play, seeking to exploit the very essence of her beliefs for their nefarious purposes. She understood the thin line between embracing darkness and falling into malevolence, and she made it her mission to ensure that the teachings of Shar were used responsibly and with the intent to bring balance and understanding to the world.

And so, Mara Kulenov, the cleric of Shar, continues her journey, navigating the complex interplay between light and shadow, loss and growth, and the mysteries that lie within the embrace of night. As she stands tall amidst the ever-changing tides of the Forgotten Realms, her unwavering faith in Shar and her commitment to bringing the truth of darkness to the world make her a beacon of hope and knowledge in the face of fear and ignorance.
