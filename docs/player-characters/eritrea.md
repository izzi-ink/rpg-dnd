## Backstory

In the bustling city of Baldur's Gate, a young human girl named Eritrea was born under mysterious circumstances. She was left on the steps of the All-Faiths Shrine as an infant, wrapped in a tattered blanket with only a small silver locket around her neck. The locket bore the symbol of a masked thief, hinting at a hidden past and unknown lineage. The clerics at the shrine took her in, and though they cared for her as best they could, they could not help her uncover the truth about her parentage.

Growing up as an orphan, Eritrea's childhood was filled with curiosity and a yearning for adventure. She often found herself observing the skilled thieves in the lower districts of Baldur's Gate, entranced by their stealth and cunning. These rogues moved like shadows, navigating the streets with ease and pulling off daring heists. Inspired by their skills and charisma, she started emulating their movements and tricks.

The orphanage's matron, a stern but caring woman named Agnes, noticed Eritrea's affinity for sneaking around and her knack for getting into places she shouldn't be. Concerned for the girl's future and recognizing the spark of potential within her, Agnes reached out to a retired rogue named Silas, who had once been a member of a famous thieves' guild in Baldur's Gate.

Silas was intrigued by the young girl's innate talent and decided to take Eritrea under his wing. He taught her the art of stealth, lockpicking, and the ways of the rogue, all while keeping her safe from the dangers of the criminal underworld. Silas had a soft spot for orphans, having lost his own family years ago, and he saw Eritrea as a chance to pass on his knowledge and redeem his past.

One day, while on a heist with Silas, Eritrea stumbled upon a hidden chamber beneath an opulent mansion. Among the treasures, she discovered a letter addressed to her, revealing that her father was a master thief who had once worked with Silas. However, the letter did not divulge her mother's identity or fate, leaving that chapter of her life still shrouded in darkness. She often stares at the silver locket, hoping it will offer some clue about her past.

Determined to uncover the truth, Eritrea sets forth on a new journey â€“ not only to master her rogue skills further but also to unravel the secrets of her lineage. Her adventures will lead her through the treacherous streets of Baldur's Gate, across dangerous landscapes, and into the depths of forgotten dungeons. Along the way, she will encounter both allies and adversaries, all while seeking to discover her true identity and place in the world.
