# Promises and other Distress Inc

Welcome, you stumbled on the campaign notes website of a small group of adventurers.
You are most welcome to read through the notes and see what we have been up to.

The storyline and material is based on the [Dungeons & Dragons 5E](https://dnd.wizards.com/) system.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
If you wanna learn more about Docusaurus, please check out their [documentation](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/).

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
